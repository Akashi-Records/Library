# Logos and Name: Theological Prefiguration of OCAM

## 1. Logos as First Principle

“In the beginning was the Word...”  
In the Johannine tradition, **Logos** represents the primordial principle of intelligibility — the creative order underlying reality.

Logos is not merely linguistic; it is the *structural ground* of being.

---

## 2. Name as Continuation of Logos

OCAM interprets **Name** as:

> **the immanent manifestation of Logos within consciousness.**

Where Logos establishes the cosmic intelligibility of the world,  
Name establishes the *personal* intelligibility of experience.

Thus, naming reenacts the primordial act of creation — but internally.

---

## 3. Shift of Creative Center

In theology, creation is divine.  
In OCAM, creation is **ontological** and occurs within consciousness.

This is not a contradiction; it is a **shift of creative center**:
- from divine Logos  
- to conscious Name  

Both generate being, but on different ontic layers.

## 4. Embodiment

The theological formula “the Word became flesh” finds its structural analog in OCAM:

- Logos → Flesh (theological)  
- Name → Form (ontological)  

Both describe **incarnation** — the movement from abstraction into structure.

---

## 5. Inner Theology of Consciousness

The triad:

Name → Form → Essence  

mirrors:

Word → Flesh → Meaning  

This parallel demonstrates that OCAM is not a departure from theological metaphysics,  
but a **philosophical internalization** of its core insights.
