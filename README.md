# Akashi Records — Library (v1.0)

This repository contains the canonical Akashi Records Library: a structured,
multi-domain philosophical–ontological archive based on the OCAM model.

Structure:

- **Ontology** — Genesis & Mission (AKR-000)
- **Philosophy** — OCAM theory, Name–Form–Essence, and Racio–Intuitio
- **Theology** — The relationship between Logos and Naming
- **Science** — Observer-based methodology for contemporary digital phenomena

All documents are written in a unified SEP-style academic format with
front-matter metadata for AI indexing and cross-referencing.

Folders:
- /ontology
- /philosophy
- /theology
- /science

This repository is part of the wider Akashi Records ecosystem and interacts
with the PORT MAP, AI Index, and Machine Layer protocols.
