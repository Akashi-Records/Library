# Racio–Intuitio: The Dualism of Human Cognition

## 1. The Two Modes of Knowing

Human cognition operates in two complementary modes:

- **Racio** — analytical, structured, linear  
- **Intuitio** — direct, synthetic, nonlinear  

OCAM interprets these modes not as opposites but as **dual aspects of cognition**.

## 2. Epistemic Dualism

Rational knowledge (**Racio**):
- distinguishes  
- segments  
- measures  
- articulates  

Intuitive knowledge (**Intuitio**):
- unifies  
- compresses meaning  
- grasps wholes  
- reveals essence  

Together they form the complete epistemic cycle.

## 3. OCAM Integration

The Name–Form–Essence triad provides structure to both modes:

- Racio shapes Form  
- Intuitio reveals Essence  

Thus cognitive dualism is an ontic dualism.

## 4. The Flow of Cognition

Typical epistemic sequence:

1. Intuitio evokes Name  
2. Racio structures Form  
3. Intuitio interprets Essence  
4. Acceptance integrates  

This cycle describes **how humans learn** on the ontological level.

## 5. Unity of the Dualism

Racio and Intuitio are not two types of knowledge but two **vectors of the same consciousness**.

OCAM frames them as:

- Racio = the structuring vector  
- Intuitio = the revealing vector  

Both are necessary for ontic completion.
